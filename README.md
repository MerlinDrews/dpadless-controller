# D-Padless Controller

This project aims to create a 3D-printable enclosure for a Nintendo Switch Sega
Genesis Wireless controller PCB. It's currently a work in progress.

The idea is to put 3 of the D-Pad directional buttons on the bottom of the
controller, separately. The up button is positioned for the left thumb. 
This should enable a user to use the directions like
a leverless controller. The 6 face buttons will also be on the bottom side on
the right side of the controller, freeing up space for thumb-controlled buttons
for the shoulder buttons on the front side.

THe controller should then be held with index, middle, and ring finger on the
back of the controller.
